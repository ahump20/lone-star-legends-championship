This PR delivers comprehensive mobile performance improvements for BlazeSportsIntel and adds a new, legally-compliant baseball game with **zero IP infringement risk**. All content is original, documented, and ready for production deployment.

## 🚀 What's New

### 1. New Phaser Baseball Game 🎮

A complete, mobile-friendly baseball game built with Phaser 3:

- **Location:** `/apps/games/phaser-bbp-web/`
- **Playable at:** `/games/bbp-web/`
- **Features:**
  - 3-inning quick-play mode

  - Touch controls optimized for mobile (48x48px minimum tap targets)
  - Programmatically generated sprites (100% original, no IP risk)
  - Scoreboard, pause menu, game state management
  - Lazy-loaded via iframe to keep main bundle lean

**Legal Compliance:** ✅
- All assets generated programmatically or documented
- No Backyard Baseball IP used
- No real athlete names or likenesses
- Documented in `/LEGAL_COMPLIANCE.md` and `/assets/LICENSES.md`

### 2. Legal Compliance Framework ⚖️

Comprehensive IP protection:

- **LEGAL_COMPLIANCE.md** - Full IP policy and guidelines
- **assets/LICENSES.md** - Asset manifest with sources and licenses
- **docs/ai-assets/prompts-and-guidelines.md** - Safe AI asset generation guide
- **CI Blocklist Check** - Automated scanning for prohibited terms (`.github/scripts/check-ip-terms.js`)

**Blocklist Includes:**
- Backyard Baseball character names
- Real athlete names (unless licensed)
- MLB/NCAA trademarks
- Franchise references

**CI Integration:**
```bash
npm run check:ip  # Run blocklist check
```

### 3. Godot Native Stub 🎮

Future-ready native game project:

- Lighthouse reports uploaded as artifacts
- PR comments with score summaries

**Configuration:** `lighthouserc.json`

### 7. Cloudflare Optimization ☁️

**File:** `public/_headers`

Optimizations:
- Long-lived cache for immutable game assets (1 year)
- Short cache for HTML (no-cache)
- Preload hints for critical resources
- CORS headers for cross-origin assets
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### 8. Build Process Updates 🛠️

**New npm scripts:**

```bash
npm run build:games     # Build all games (Phaser + OG Remaster)
npm run build:phaser    # Build Phaser game only
npm run dev:phaser      # Local Phaser development server
npm run check:ip        # Run IP blocklist validation
```

**Updated scripts:**
- `npm run build` now includes `build:games`
- All games built and copied to `public/` during deployment

### 9. Comprehensive Documentation 📚

New docs:
- **docs/GAME_README.md** - Game development guide (build, test, deploy)
- **docs/IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION.md** - Image optimization strategies
- **docs/ai-assets/prompts-and-guidelines.md** - Safe AI asset creation
