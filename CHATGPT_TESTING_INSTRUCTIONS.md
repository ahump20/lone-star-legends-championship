## 🔍 TESTING SCOPE

### Phase 1: Code Review & Static Analysis

**Task 1.1: File Structure Audit**
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/user/lone-star-legends-championship

# List all new game files
ls -la games/baseball/*.html
ls -la js/character*.js js/special*.js js/stadium*.js js/audio*.js js/season*.js js/game-integration*.js js/enhanced-game-ui*.js js/team-selection*.js
ls -la data/backyard-roster.json
ls -la css/game-ui.css
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] All 19 expected files exist
- [ ] No unexpected files present
- [ ] File permissions are correct (readable)
- [ ] File sizes are reasonable (not empty, not corrupted)

**Task 1.2: JSON Data Validation**
```bash
# Validate JSON structure
python3 -m json.tool data/backyard-roster.json > /dev/null
echo $?  # Should output 0 if valid

# Check JSON content
cat data/backyard-roster.json | grep -c "\"id\"" | head -1  # Should show 18 (characters count)
```

**Verify:**

node --check js/stadium-manager.js
node --check js/audio-manager.js
node --check js/enhanced-game-ui.js

grep -c "<script src=" games/baseball/index.html
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Proper DOCTYPE declarations
- [ ] All HTML tags properly closed
- [ ] Script tags reference correct paths

---

### Phase 2: Dependency & Integration Analysis

**Task 2.1: Script Load Order**

Examine `games/baseball/index.html` and verify script load order:

```bash
grep -n "<script src=" games/baseball/index.html
```

**Expected order:**
1. Three.js (external CDN)
2. `/js/enhanced-3d-engine.js`
3. `/js/baseball-game-engine.js`
4. Baseball game initialization
5. Character manager
6. Character renderer
7. Special abilities
8. Stadium manager
9. Audio manager
10. Enhanced game UI
11. Season mode
12. Game integration

**Verify:**
- [ ] Dependencies load in correct order
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] All paths use absolute paths (`/js/...`) not relative

**Task 2.2: Global Variables Check**

Search for global variable usage:

```bash
grep -n "window\." js/game-integration.js
grep -n "window\.gameEngine" games/baseball/index.html
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] `window.gameEngine` is created before integration scripts
- [ ] `window.sandlotGame` is created in game-integration.js
- [ ] No conflicting global variables
- [ ] Proper scoping used

**Task 2.3: CSS Dependencies**

```bash
grep -n "link rel=\"stylesheet\"" games/baseball/index.html
grep -n "\.css" games/baseball/*.html
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] `/css/game-ui.css` is loaded
- [ ] CSS paths are absolute
- [ ] No broken stylesheet links

---

### Phase 3: Character System Testing

**Task 3.1: Character Data Integrity**

Read and analyze character data:

```bash
# View character structure
python3 -c "import json; data = json.load(open('data/backyard-roster.json')); print('Characters:', len(data['characters'])); print('First character:', json.dumps(data['characters'][0], indent=2))"
```

**Verify each character has:**
- [ ] Unique ID (char_001 through char_018)
- [ ] Name (first and nickname)
- [ ] Age (8-12)
- [ ] Bio/backstory
- [ ] Stats (batting, power, speed, pitching, fielding) on 1-10 scale
- [ ] Position (P, C, 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, LF, CF, RF)
- [ ] Special ability with id, name, description, cooldown, type
- [ ] Personality traits (array)
- [ ] Appearance data (skinTone, hairStyle, hairColor, accessories)
- [ ] Favorite number (10-99)

**Task 3.2: Character Balance Check**

Analyze stat distribution:

```bash
# Extract stats and analyze
python3 << 'EOF'
import json
data = json.load(open('data/backyard-roster.json'))
chars = data['characters']

# Calculate average stats
total_batting = sum(c['stats']['batting'] for c in chars)
total_power = sum(c['stats']['power'] for c in chars)
total_speed = sum(c['stats']['speed'] for c in chars)
total_pitching = sum(c['stats']['pitching'] for c in chars)
total_fielding = sum(c['stats']['fielding'] for c in chars)

print(f"Average Batting: {total_batting/18:.2f}")
print(f"Average Power: {total_power/18:.2f}")
print(f"Average Speed: {total_speed/18:.2f}")
print(f"Average Pitching: {total_pitching/18:.2f}")
print(f"Average Fielding: {total_fielding/18:.2f}")

# Find min/max
print(f"\nBest batter: {max(chars, key=lambda x: x['stats']['batting'])['name']}")
print(f"Most power: {max(chars, key=lambda x: x['stats']['power'])['name']}")
print(f"Fastest: {max(chars, key=lambda x: x['stats']['speed'])['name']}")
print(f"Best pitcher: {max(chars, key=lambda x: x['stats']['pitching'])['name']}")
EOF
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Average stats are around 6-7 (balanced)
- [ ] At least 2-3 "star" players (multiple 9-10 stats)
- [ ] No character has all stats below 4 (unusable)
- [ ] No character has all stats above 8 (overpowered)
- [ ] Good variety in stat distributions

**Task 3.3: Special Abilities Analysis**

```bash
# List all abilities
python3 << 'EOF'
import json
data = json.load(open('data/backyard-roster.json'))
abilities = {}
for char in data['characters']:
    ability = char['specialAbility']
    ability_id = ability['id']
    if ability_id in abilities:
        print(f"WARNING: Duplicate ability ID: {ability_id}")
    abilities[ability_id] = {
        'name': ability['name'],
        'type': ability['type'],
        'character': char['name']
    }

print(f"Total unique abilities: {len(abilities)}")
print("\nAbility types:")
for aid, info in abilities.items():
    print(f"  {info['type']}: {info['name']} ({info['character']})")
EOF
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] All ability IDs are unique
- [ ] Variety of ability types (batting, pitching, fielding, running, team, passive)
- [ ] Reasonable cooldown values (0 for passive, 1-6 for active)
- [ ] Abilities match character archetypes (e.g., speed character has speed ability)

data = json.load(open('data/backyard-roster.json'))
our_chars = [c['name'] for c in data['characters']]

conflicts = []
for bb in bb_chars:
    for our in our_chars:
        if bb.lower() in our.lower() or our.lower() in bb.lower():
            conflicts.append(f"Potential conflict: {our} vs {bb}")

if conflicts:
    print("WARNING: Potential name conflicts found:")
    for c in conflicts:
        print(f"  {c}")
else:

for a in sorted(set(abilities)):
    print(f"  - {a}")
EOF
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] All ability names are original

5. Selects 9 characters (Step 2)
6. Orders lineup (Step 3)
7. Clicks "Play Ball"
8. Data saved to sessionStorage
9. Redirected to index.html
10. Game loads with selected teams
11. Game integration activates
12. User plays game
```

**Verify code supports this flow:**

```bash
# Check redirects
grep -n "window.location.href" games/baseball/menu.html games/baseball/select-team.html js/team-selection.js

# Check sessionStorage usage
grep -n "sessionStorage.setItem\|sessionStorage.getItem" js/team-selection.js js/game-integration.js
```

**Verify:**

2. CharacterManager → TeamSelectionUI
3. User selection → sessionStorage
4. sessionStorage → GameIntegration.loadSelectedTeams()
5. GameIntegration → BaseballGameEngine (override generateLineup)

```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Try-catch blocks around fetch calls
- [ ] Error messages logged to console

```bash
grep -n "if (!.*)" js/game-integration.js | head -10
grep -n "||" js/character-manager.js | head -10
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Checks for null/undefined before using data

## ⚡ START TESTING IMMEDIATELY

Begin with Phase 1 and work through systematically. Focus on:
1. **Correctness** - Does it work?
2. **Completeness** - Is anything missing?
3. **Quality** - Is the code good?
4. **Security** - Is it safe?
5. **Performance** - Is it fast enough?
6. **Usability** - Is it user-friendly?

**Remember:** You're testing a game that was built in a few hours by an AI. It's expected to have some rough edges. Focus on:
- Game-breaking bugs (critical)
- Missing functionality (high)
- Code quality issues (medium)
- Polish items (low)

Good luck, Agent! 🚀
