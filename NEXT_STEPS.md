// Example integration
import MLBStats from 'mlb-stats-api';
const stats = new MLBStats();
const playerData = await stats.getPlayer('Mike Trout');
```

### 2. Three.js 3D Visualization
**Repository**: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js
- Convert 2D field to 3D environment
- Add camera angles (broadcast, pitcher view, batter view)

   - Statistical simulation engine
   - Play-by-play generation

2. **Angular-Baseball** (kuhe/Angular-Baseball)
   - TypeScript baseball model
   - 3D rendering capabilities

3. **MLB-StatsAPI** (Python, but concepts portable)
   - Data structures for stats
   - API integration patterns

### Game Engine Resources
1. **Phaser** (https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)
