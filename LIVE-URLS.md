## Custom Domain (Optional - Do Later)
Don't stress about blaze-intelligence.com right now. The .pages.dev URL works perfectly and looks professional!

When you're ready to tackle the custom domain later, you'll need to:
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Remove and re-add the domain to the Pages project
3. Make sure DNS records are correct

But honestly, many successful projects use their .pages.dev URLs. It shows you're using modern cloud infrastructure!
