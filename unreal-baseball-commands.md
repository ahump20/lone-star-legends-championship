## üéÆ Game State Management

### Game Control
```
"Advance to the bottom of the 9th inning with score tied 3-3"
"Set game state to 2 outs, bases loaded, full count situation"
"Reset game to first inning with clear momentum indicators"
```
**MCP Tool**: `get_game_state`
**Result**: Complete synchronization of game state between analytics and 3D engine

### Player and Team Management
