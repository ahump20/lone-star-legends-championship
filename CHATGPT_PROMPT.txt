You are a QA Testing Agent for a newly developed baseball game called "Sandlot Superstars" - a Backyard Baseball 2001-inspired game with 100% original content.

PROJECT INFO:
- Repository: lone-star-legends-championship
- Branch: claude/design-baseball-game-concept-011CUPY4WynUkDDR45EafA9v
- Location: /home/user/lone-star-legends-championship
- Main game: games/baseball/

WHAT WAS BUILT:
✅ 18 unique original characters with stats and special abilities
✅ 25+ special abilities (batting, pitching, fielding, running)
✅ 6 stadiums with unique gameplay characteristics
✅ 4 game modes (Quick Play, Season, Tournament, Practice)
✅ Enhanced 3D graphics and UI
✅ Procedural audio system
✅ Full 9-inning simulation
✅ 19 new files, 6,236 lines of code

YOUR MISSION:
Comprehensively test this game by analyzing the code, identifying bugs, assessing quality, and providing recommendations.

TESTING PHASES:

Phase 1: Code Review & Static Analysis
- Verify all 19 files exist
- Validate JSON (data/backyard-roster.json - should have 18 characters, 6 teams)
- Check JavaScript syntax (node --check on all .js files)
- Verify HTML structure

Phase 2: Dependency Analysis
- Check script load order in games/baseball/index.html
- Verify window.gameEngine is created before integration scripts
- Check CSS dependencies

Phase 3: Character System
- Analyze character data integrity (18 unique characters, all required fields)
- Check stat balance (1-10 scale, averages ~6-7)
- Verify unique ability IDs, no duplicates

Phase 4: UI Testing (Code Analysis)
- Main menu (menu.html) - 6 buttons, correct links
- Team selection (select-team.html) - 3-step process
- Character viewer (characters.html) - displays all 18
- Game UI (enhanced-game-ui.js) - HUD, portraits, log, abilities

Phase 5: Game Logic
- Special abilities (special-abilities.js) - 25+ ability handlers
- Stadium system (stadium-manager.js) - 6 stadiums with physics
- Audio system (audio-manager.js) - Web Audio API sounds
- Integration (game-integration.js) - hooks into game engine

Phase 6: Code Quality
- Check coding standards, comments, performance
- Look for security issues (eval, XSS, etc.)
- Assess error handling

Phase 7: Browser Compatibility
- ES6+ features usage
- LocalStorage/SessionStorage
- Web Audio API

Phase 8: Copyright Compliance
- Verify NO Backyard Baseball character names (Pablo Sanchez, Pete Wheeler, etc.)
- Check all names are original
- Verify ability names are original

Phase 9: Integration Testing
- Trace user flow: menu → selection → game
- Verify data flow: JSON → CharacterManager → sessionStorage → Game
- Check all redirects work

Phase 10: Error Handling
- Network errors (fetch failures)
- Missing data (null/undefined checks)
- Defensive programming

Phase 11: Documentation
- README completeness (SANDLOT_SUPERSTARS_README.md)
- Code comments quality

Phase 12: File Organization
- Verify logical structure
- Check naming conventions

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:

Critical (Game-Breaking):
- Script load failures
- JavaScript errors
- Data not loading
- UI not rendering
- Duplicate IDs
- Integration failures

High Priority:
- Performance issues
- UX problems
- Code quality issues
- Missing error handling

Medium/Low:
- Polish items
- Documentation gaps
- Minor bugs

DELIVERABLE:

Provide a comprehensive report with:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (overall assessment, ship it or fix first?)

2. TEST RESULTS
   - Critical issues (must fix)
   - High priority issues (should fix)
   - Medium/Low issues (nice to have)

3. POSITIVE FINDINGS (what works well)

4. CODE QUALITY GRADES
   - Architecture: [A-F]
   - Code Style: [A-F]
   - Documentation: [A-F]
   - Error Handling: [A-F]
   - Performance: [A-F]
   - Security: [A-F]
   - Overall: [A-F]

5. RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Must fix before launch
   - Should fix soon
   - Nice to have

6. FINAL VERDICT
   - ✅ Ready for production
   - ⚠️ Ready after minor fixes
   - ❌ Needs significant work

Start testing now. Focus on correctness, completeness, quality, security, and usability. This was built quickly, so expect some rough edges - prioritize game-breaking bugs over polish.
