## How to Play - Tutorial

### First Inning, Bottom Half

2. Backyard Blazers now pitch
3. Same process as top half
4. 3 outs advances to 2nd inning

### Subsequent Innings

3. Best strategy: Mix up your swing timing

### Game End

## Tips & Strategy

### For Pitching
- Watch the count - pitch confidently with advantage
- Strike zone is large (60% of pitches)
- Don't worry too much - outcome is somewhat random

### For Batting  
- Swing during pitch animation for best results
- Early swing = more likely to miss
- Late swing = more likely to make contact
- With 2 strikes, be careful (foul balls won't help)

### Scoring
- Home runs are rare (5%) but always score
- Singles are most common (30%) but score 30% of time
- Doubles and triples score more frequently
- Build runs through multiple hits
