# Blaze Intelligence Image Integration Strategy

## Strategic Approach (Four Pillars Framework)

### CARDINALS Principle: Professional Excellence
**"Are we doing this the right way?"**
- Use athletic photos minimally and strategically
- Focus on data visualization and analytics platform
- Maintain enterprise-level professional aesthetic

### Image Usage Guidelines

## 1. AVOID: High School Hero Gallery
❌ Don't create a "glory days" section
❌ Don't use multiple action shots throughout site
❌ Don't lead with athletic achievements from 2008-2009

## 2. STRATEGIC: Limited Professional Context
✅ **Single professional headshot** in About/Founder section
✅ **One subtle background** element showing sports understanding
✅ **Data visualization** as primary visual content

## 3. Recommended Image Placement

### Primary Images (Analytics Focus)
1. **Hero Section**: Data dashboard visualization (not personal photos)
2. **Platform Features**: Screenshots of actual analytics tools
3. **Team Sections**: Team logos/stadiums (Cardinals, Titans, Longhorns, Grizzlies)
4. **Case Studies**: Charts, graphs, performance metrics

### Limited Personal Images
1. **About/Founder Section ONLY**:
   - One professional current photo (if available)
   - Background texture using field/stadium (heavily blurred/darkened)
   
2. **Experience Context** (if needed):
   - Small icon-sized image showing sports background
   - Focus on journey from player to analyst

## 4. Image Processing Strategy

### For Athletic Photos (if used):
```css
/* Heavy processing to de-emphasize personal focus */
.founder-background {
  filter: blur(8px) brightness(0.3) saturate(0.5);
  opacity: 0.2;
  position: absolute;
  z-index: -1;
}
```

### Preferred Visual Content:
1. Analytics dashboards
2. Data visualizations
3. Team performance charts
4. Stadium/field views (without personal focus)
5. Abstract sports patterns/textures

## 5. Cloudflare Images Upload IDs

### Recommended Uploads:
- `analytics-dashboard-main` - Primary platform screenshot
- `data-visualization-hero` - Hero section background
- `team-logos-composite` - Combined team branding
- `austin-professional-2025` - Current professional photo (if available)

### Athletic Photos (Limited Use):
- `sports-background-texture` - Heavily processed field texture
- NOT individual action shots

## 6. Content Messaging Focus

Instead of: "Former athlete turned analyst"
Use: "Data-driven sports intelligence expert"

Instead of: "High school football/baseball player"
Use: "Deep understanding of athletic performance metrics"

Instead of: Personal athletic achievements
Use: Platform capabilities and client success stories

## 7. Implementation Priority

1. **First**: Upload and integrate data visualization images
2. **Second**: Add team-related imagery (logos, stadiums)
3. **Third**: Platform screenshots and features
4. **Last**: Minimal personal photo in founder section only

## TITANS Principle Check
**"What's the real work that needs doing?"**
- Building trust through expertise, not past athletics
- Demonstrating current analytical capabilities
- Showing professional platform, not personal history

## LONGHORNS Excellence Standard
**"Does this meet championship-level excellence?"**
- Professional enterprise aesthetic ✓
- Focus on current value proposition ✓
- Avoid amateur "yearbook" presentation ✓

## GRIZZLIES Team Focus
**"How do we grind through this together?"**
- Highlight team analytics, not individual glory
- Show collaborative platform features
- Emphasize helping teams win, not personal wins

---

## Conclusion
The uploaded photos can serve as background context but should NOT be featured prominently. The platform's strength comes from analytical expertise and professional presentation, not athletic history.

**Remember**: Blaze Intelligence is a forward-looking analytics platform, not a retrospective of past athletic achievements.
