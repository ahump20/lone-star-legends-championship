# AI Asset Generation - Prompts & Guidelines

## Overview

This guide provides safe, legally compliant prompts for generating original baseball game assets using AI tools. **The goal is to create unique, generic content that avoids any resemblance to copyrighted intellectual property.**

## Core Principles

### ✅ DO

- Use **generic style descriptions** ("cartoony", "pixel art", "90s aesthetic")
- Focus on **common baseball elements** (bats, balls, fields, bases)
- Request **simple, kid-friendly designs**
- Specify **unique color palettes** to ensure originality
- Use **geometric or abstract approaches** for placeholder art
- Document **every prompt used** with the generated asset

### ❌ DON'T

- Mention **specific games by name** (Backyard Baseball, MVP Baseball, etc.)
- Reference **copyrighted characters** or franchises
- Request **real athlete likenesses** or names
- Use **trademarked terms** (MLB, Yankees, etc.)
- Copy **distinctive art styles** from known games
- Generate content resembling **specific IP**

## Verification Checklist

Before using AI-generated assets:

### Visual Review

- [ ] Does NOT resemble Backyard Baseball characters/assets
- [ ] Does NOT include real athlete likenesses
- [ ] Does NOT include trademarked logos (MLB, team logos)
- [ ] Does NOT include copyrighted text or names
- [ ] Appears generic and original
- [ ] Suitable for children's content rating

### Reverse Image Search

Use Google Images or TinEye to verify uniqueness:

```bash
# Upload your generated image to:
1. https://images.google.com/ (upload image icon)
2. https://tineye.com/

# Check results:
- No exact matches → Good!
- Generic similar results → Probably safe
- Specific game/character matches → DO NOT USE
```

### Documentation

After verification, document in `/assets/LICENSES.md`:

```markdown
#### [filename].png
- **Source:** AI-generated via [Tool Name]
- **Prompt:** "[exact prompt]"
- **Generated:** 2025-11-02
- **Reviewed:** Reverse image search, no conflicts
- **License:** CC0 (Public Domain)
```

## Example Workflow

### Step-by-Step Asset Creation

**Goal:** Create a unique baseball batter sprite

```
1. CRAFT PROMPT:
   "Original cartoon baseball batter, kid-friendly, simple geometric
   shapes, blue jersey, white pants, holding brown bat, batting stance,
   2D vector art, transparent background, no facial features, bright colors"

2. GENERATE (using Stable Diffusion/DALL-E):
   - Generate 4-6 variations
   - Select best result

3. VERIFY:
   - Visual inspection: Not similar to known IP?
   - Reverse image search: No matches to existing games?
   - Color palette unique?

4. REFINE (if needed):
   - Edit in GIMP/Photoshop to remove any problematic elements
   - Adjust colors to ensure uniqueness
   - Simplify design if too detailed

5. DOCUMENT:
   - Save prompt to `/docs/ai-assets/prompts/batter-sprite-prompt.txt`
   - Add entry to `/assets/LICENSES.md`
   - Note any modifications made

6. COMMIT:
   git add assets/sprites/batter.png
   git add docs/ai-assets/prompts/batter-sprite-prompt.txt
   git commit -m "Add original AI-generated batter sprite (CC0)"
```

## Fallback: Manual Creation

If AI-generated assets are too risky or unavailable:

### Simple Placeholder Graphics

**Using HTML5 Canvas (Programmatic):**

```javascript
// Generate a simple circular player sprite
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
canvas.width = 64;
canvas.height = 64;
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

// Head
ctx.fillStyle = '#FFD700'; // Gold
ctx.arc(32, 24, 12, 0, Math.PI * 2);
ctx.fill();

// Body
ctx.fillStyle = '#0066CC'; // Blue
ctx.fillRect(24, 36, 16, 24);

// Export as PNG
const dataURL = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
```

**Using SVG:**

```xml
<svg width="64" height="64" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Head -->
  <circle cx="32" cy="24" r="12" fill="#FFD700"/>
  <!-- Body -->
  <rect x="24" y="36" width="16" height="24" fill="#0066CC"/>
  <!-- Bat -->
  <rect x="48" y="30" width="4" height="30" fill="#8B4513"
        transform="rotate(45 50 45)"/>
</svg>
```

Benefits:
- 100% original and safe
- Fully customizable
- Tiny file sizes
- No license concerns
