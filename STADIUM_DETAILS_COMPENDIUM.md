- **Surface**: Natural grass
- **Unlocked**: By default (tutorial stadium)

### Complete Lore
*The original. The classic. The field where legends are born.*

Sunny Park has been the heart of sandlot baseball for 70 years. Built by neighborhood kids in the summer of 1955, this field has seen thousands of games, scraped knees, and championship dreams. The outfield fence is made of weathered wooden planks, each carved with initials of players who hit home runs here. The backstop is chain-link with ivy growing through it. An old oak tree stands in deep center field, exactly 420 feet from home plate - locals call it "The Monster."

**Local Legend**: On August 15, 1962, a kid named Tommy "Ace" Henderson hit a ball that cleared the oak tree and landed in Mrs. Patterson's garden three houses away. The ball was never found. Some say she kept it. Others say it's still there, buried under decades of roses. Every August 15th, old-timers gather to tell the story.

## 2. üåã VOLCANO VALLEY

### Basic Information
- **ID**: `volcano_valley`
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Location**: Active volcano crater, Ring of Fire
- **Opened**: 2021 (newest extreme venue)
- **Capacity**: 8,000 (brave spectators only)
- **Surface**: Volcanic rock composite (black)
- **Unlocked**: Win 10 games

### Complete Lore
*Where baseball meets geological wonder.*

Built inside the dormant (they say) crater of Mount Inferno, this stadium pushes the limits of extreme sports venues. The field sits 200 feet below the crater rim, surrounded by sheer volcanic rock walls. Lava tubes beneath the field create thermal updrafts that send fly balls soaring to unprecedented heights. The constant rumble of the volcano provides an ominous soundtrack.

**Construction Story**: Billionaire adventurer Marcus "Madman" Thorne spent $500 million building this stadium after winning a bet. When geologists said it couldn't be done, he doubled down. The field is built on shock-absorbing platforms that can withstand magnitude 6.0 earthquakes. Lava-proof glass separates spectators from the playing surface.

**The Great Eruption of 2023**: During a championship game, the volcano actually erupted. Players fled as lava fountains shot up beyond the outfield. Miraculously, the stadium's cooling systems worked - the game resumed 2 hours later. That game is now called "The Inferno Classic."

### Exact Dimensions
- **Left Field**: 330 feet (but feels like 280 due to thermal lift)
- **Center Field**: 420 feet (deepest in the league)
- **Right Field**: 330 feet
- **Crater Rim**: 200 feet above field
- **Magma Pool**: 800 feet below field (visible through glass panels)

### Physics Characteristics (Detailed)
```javascript
{
    fenceDistance: 1.2,          // Deep fences to compensate for lift
    ballSpeed: 1.15,             // Thinner air due to heat
    windFactor: 0.25,            // Unpredictable swirling winds
    groundSpeed: 1.2,            // Smooth volcanic rock
    visibility: 0.85,            // Heat shimmer, ash particles
    thermalUplift: 0.3,          // Massive updrafts
    altitude: 3200,              // Feet above sea level
    temperature: 95,             // ¬∞F - Brutal heat
    humidity: 5,                 // % - Desert dry
    gasConcentration: 0.02,      // Sulfur dioxide (affects stamina)
    earthquakeChance: 0.15,      // 15% chance per inning
    lavaGlowIntensity: 0.8       // How much glow from magma
}
```

### Environmental Features
- **Sky**: Orange-red haze (#FF4500)
- **Playing Surface**: Obsidian black (#1A0A00)
- **Walls**: Dark red volcanic rock (#8B0000)
- **Lighting**: Lava glow + massive floodlights
- **Special**: Visible lava flows in left field bullpen area
- **Scoreboard**: LED screen with heat-resistant coating
- **Seating**: Heat-reflective material, cooling systems

### Thermal Updraft Mechanics
**How It Works**:
- Lava pools 800 feet below heat the air
- Hot air rises through lava tubes at 15 MPH
- Creates "elevator effect" for fly balls
- Most pronounced in left-center gap

**Exact Formula**:
```
Thermal Lift = base_lift * (exit_velo / 100) * (launch_angle / 45) * wind_modifier
Where:
- base_lift = 30% bonus to carry distance
- Optimal launch angle: 35-40 degrees (not typical 30)
- Wind can add up to 15% more lift
```

**Strategic Impact**:
- Home runs 50+ feet longer than normal
- Pop-ups become deep fly balls
- Infield flies can carry to warning track
- Pitchers must keep ball down

### Earthquake System
**Frequency**: Random chance each inning (15%)

**Effects When Triggered**:
1. **Minor Quake** (75% of quakes):
   - Screen shakes for 3 seconds
   - Fielders stumble (reaction time -20%)
   - Ball can take bad hop
   - Duration: 1 play

2. **Moderate Quake** (20% of quakes):
   - Screen shakes violently for 5 seconds
   - All players fall down
   - Current play restarted
   - Crack appears in outfield (cosmetic)
   - Duration: 1 minute

3. **Major Quake** (5% of quakes):
   - Game paused for safety
   - Lava fountain erupts in background
   - Stadium announcer says "EVACUATE!"
   - Players sprint to dugout
   - Resume after 2 minutes
   - Crowd goes wild

**Player Adaptation**:
- After 5 games here, quake resistance +30%
- Local players have home field advantage
- Special "Quake-Proof" trait available

### Weather Patterns
- **Clear Heat**: 60% (brutal sun)
- **Ash Fall**: 25% (reduced visibility)
- **Volcanic Storm**: 10% (lightning + ash)
- **Eruption**: 5% (game-changing event)

### Eruption Event (Rare)
**Chance**: 5% per game
**Warning Signs**:
- Rumbling intensifies
- Lava glow brightens
- Temperature spikes 10¬∞F
- Sulfur smell increases

**When It Happens**:
1. Lava fountain shoots up behind outfield wall
2. Hot ash falls like snow
3. Visibility drops to 60%
4. Thermal updrafts increase to 50%
5. Fielders panic (errors +30%)
6. Lasts 3 innings then subsides

**Achievement**: "Eruption Survivor" - Win during eruption

### Easter Eggs & Secrets
1. **Lava Ball**: If ball lands in lava viewing pool, it melts (new ball awarded, +50 style points)
2. **Obsidian Find**: Ground balls sometimes uncover small obsidian chunks
3. **Heat Mirage**: On hottest days, ghost players appear
4. **Volcano Whisperer**: Listen closely for volcano's "voice" (rumble patterns)
5. **Phoenix Rising**: Hit a home run during eruption for legendary status
6. **Thermal Anomaly Zone**: Sweet spot in left-center where lift is 50% higher

### Stadium-Specific Achievements

- **Lava Lord**: Hit 100 home runs here
- **Ash Cloud**: Strike out 20 batters in one game

### Strategic Considerations

**Hitting Strategy**:
- **Flyball Approach**: Optimal due to thermal lift
- **Pull Power**: Left-center gap has max thermal effect
- **High Launch Angle**: 35-40¬∞ is sweet spot (not usual 30¬∞)
- **Elevate Everything**: Ground balls die on rock surface

**Pitching Strategy**:
- **Keep It Down**: Sinkers and two-seamers essential
- **Avoid Four-Seam**: Fastballs can carry out
- **Breaking Balls**: Extra drop due to hot air
- **Stamina Management**: Heat drains energy faster

**Fielding Strategy**:
- **Play Deep**: Balls carry farther
- **Prepare for Hops**: Volcanic surface creates bad bounces
- **Earthquake Awareness**: Always be ready to stabilize

**Team Building**:
- **Ground Ball Pitchers**: Essential
- **High Stamina**: Heat resistance needed
- **Power Hitters**: Take advantage of lift
- **Avoid Speed Demons**: Heat slows them down

### Real-World Inspiration
- Volcanoes Stadium (Hawaii, minor league concept)
- Mount Doom from Lord of the Rings aesthetic

## 3. ‚ùÑÔ∏è ICE PALACE ARENA

### Basic Information
- **ID**: `ice_palace`
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Location**: Arctic Circle, Northern Canada
- **Opened**: 2019
- **Capacity**: 12,000 (climate-controlled dome)
- **Surface**: Synthetic turf with ice patches
- **Unlocked**: Hit 5 home runs total

### Complete Lore
*Where winter magic meets America's pastime.*

The Ice Palace was built as an answer to "Can you play baseball in the Arctic?" The answer: Yes, but it's beautiful chaos. Built by Canadian philanthropist Jean-Pierre Gla cier (yes, that's his real name), this venue celebrates winter sports while honoring baseball. The field has intentional ice patches that make fielding a nightmare and base running a figure skating routine.

**The Frozen Game**: In the inaugural game, temperatures dropped so low that a batted ball literally froze mid-air and fell straight down. Umpires didn't know how to call it. It's now ruled a "frozen foul" - replay the pitch.

**Aurora Borealis Games**: On special nights, the dome's roof opens to reveal the Northern Lights. Players report that hitting under the Aurora brings good luck. Statistics confirm this is actually true (+15% batting average on Aurora nights).

### Exact Dimensions
- **Left Field**: 320 feet
- **Center Field**: 410 feet
- **Right Field**: 320 feet
- **Ice Rink Zones**: 3 areas in outfield (120 sq ft each)
- **Frozen Warning Track**: 10 feet deep, completely ice

### Physics Characteristics (Detailed)
```javascript
{
    fenceDistance: 1.1,           // Slightly deep fences
    ballSpeed: 0.85,              // Cold air is denser
    windFactor: -0.15,            // Indoor, controlled environment
    groundSpeed: 1.5,             // ICE FAST!
    visibility: 1.0,              // Perfect visibility
    slipperiness: 0.8,            // 80% chance to slip on ice
    altitude: 150,                // Near sea level
    temperature: 28,              // ¬∞F - Below freezing
    humidity: 90,                 // % - High (ice evaporation)
    icePercentage: 0.15,          // 15% of field is ice
    frostbiteRisk: 0.05           // Minor risk for fielders
}
```

### Ice Patch System (Detailed)

**Ice Patch Locations** (randomly placed each game):
1. **Left-Center Gap**: Oval patch (30x20 feet)
2. **Right Field Line**: Diagonal strip (40x15 feet)
3. **Second Base Area**: Circle (15 foot radius)
4. **Warning Track**: Full perimeter (always iced)

**Slip Mechanics**:
```javascript
slipChance = (playerSpeed * 0.5) + (iceSlipperiness * 0.4) - (bodyType.traction * 0.1)

Results:
- No Slip (60%): Normal play
- Minor Slip (30%): -1 second reaction time
- Full Slip (9%): Player falls, ball advances
- Epic Fail (1%): Player slides 20 feet, highlight reel
```

**Strategic Adaptations**:
- **Cleats Matter**: Special "ice cleats" reduce slip by 40%
- **Speed Tradeoff**: Going slow = less slip, but slower play
- **Body Type**: Stocky players slip less (lower center of gravity)
- **Experience**: After 10 games, slip chance -25%

### Cold Weather Effects

**Player Stamina**:
- Base stamina drain: +15% per inning
- Mitigation: Heated dugouts restore 50% stamina
- Extreme: At <20¬∞F, stamina drain doubles

**Ball Physics**:
- **Compression**: Cold ball travels 20-30 feet less
- **Deadening**: Sounds different off bat (dull "thunk")
- **Grip**: Pitchers struggle with control (walk rate +10%)

**Fielding**:
- **Cold Hands**: Catching errors +15%
- **Stiff Fingers**: Throwing accuracy -10%
- **Frozen Mitts**: Balls pop out easier

### Blizzard System

**Frequency**: 20% chance per game

**Progression**:
1. **Warning**: Snow flurries appear (inning 1-3)
2. **Build-Up**: Snow accumulates on field (inning 4-6)
3. **Blizzard Peak**: White-out conditions (inning 7-9)

**Blizzard Effects**:
- **Visibility**: Drops from 100% to 50%
- **Wind**: Adds 0.3 wind factor (random direction)
- **Ice**: All remaining grass becomes ice
- **Snow Accumulation**: Ball can get buried (ground rule double if lost)

**Player Experience**:
- Batters see ball late (+20% strikeouts)
- Fielders lose ball in snow (error rate doubles)
- Base runners slip more (caught stealing +30%)
- Umpires make more bad calls (+40% incorrect calls)

### Aurora Borealis Nights

**Frequency**: 10% of games (random)

**Visual Effects**:
- Dome roof opens
- Green/purple lights dance across sky

### Strategic Considerations

**Hitting Strategy**:
- **Hard Contact**: Ball doesn't carry, need to drive it
- **Line Drives**: Better than fly balls (ball dies)
- **Gap Approach**: Ice patches in outfield cause misplays
- **Aurora Nights**: Swing for fences (magic is real)

**Pitching Strategy**:
- **Finesse Over Power**: Cold ball won't reach
- **Location**: Control is king, movement is wild
- **Quick Pace**: Don't let hands freeze
- **Grip**: Rosin bag essential

**Fielding Strategy**:
- **Take Extra Time**: Rush = slip
- **Watch Ice**: Know where patches are
- **Wear Ice Cleats**: Non-negotiable
