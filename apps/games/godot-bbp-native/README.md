# Sandlot Sluggers Native Prototype

This Godot 4 project mirrors the Phaser MVP structure with placeholder scenes so the team can explore native builds.

## Structure

- `scenes/Menu.tscn` – lightweight menu with a start button.
- `scenes/Game.tscn` – placeholder gameplay root with TODO hooks.
- `scripts/` – simple scripts showing where to attach core logic.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Godot 4.x](https://godotengine.org/download).
2. Open this folder as a project.
3. Press **Play** to run the menu. The game scene currently logs a stub message.

## Next Steps

- Replace placeholder geometry with original 2D/3D assets (see `docs/ai-assets` for guardrails).
- Implement touch/gamepad controls mirroring the Phaser experience.
- Integrate Godot export templates targeting Android and iOS once gameplay is complete.
