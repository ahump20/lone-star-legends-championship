```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()...
```

#### Asset Caching Strategy
- CSS/JS/Images: 1 year immutable cache
- HTML: 1 hour cache with must-revalidate
- Service Worker: No cache (always fresh)
- API endpoints: No cache

### 4. Routing Configuration - OPTIMIZED ✅

**Updated `_routes.json`:**
```json
{
